    <p>I grew up on a small farm in Iowa for most of my life where I helped my dad out with various chores. This inspired a life-long passion for taking care of animals and a love for the outdoors. Even though I love the quiet beauty of Iowa, my husband and I decided to make a move to Orlando Florida about six months ago.

    <p>So far, my favorite thing about living in Florida is the fact that the Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf are only an hour and a half drive away. I aspire to learn how to surf sometime this year, once I can find the time! I try to keep a healthy work/life balance and while I enjoy learning and can be consumed by a new topic, I try to take a break and 
relax with a good thriller or action movie. I also like to spend my down time reading books that focus on worlds of fantasy and science fiction.
